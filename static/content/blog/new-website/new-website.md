## 1. an apology for the clickbait title 
I don't really think that React and its affiliates are going anywhere, but I do feel like we're in the middle of a big shift in how the internet
works. There are a lot of factors at play here - inflation, the decline of advertising as a dependable cash cow, the public malaise of anything related to "big tech," the recent breakthroughs in AI, and changing trends in design are some of the things that have been on my mind a lot recently. So that's why I decided to basically abandon my old personal website and try something completely different (as we developers are often wont to do).

### 1.1 Out with the old
My previous website, for reference, was made with TypeScript and NextJS and deployed on Digital Ocean. In my opinion, the TS/NextJS combo is the the least painful approach to our current SPA- and JavaScript-dominated epoch of web history. When you're working with a large enough frontend project using React, having typed props and callback functions makes debugging your code go from "a hellish nightmare and impossible" to simply "kinda annoying." I also like NextJS's builtin support for routing, server-side rendering, and serverless functions. As much as I truly think I'm too good for JavaScript, I do also like working in a mature software ecosystem with broad support and infrastructure. Not everything has to be cutting-edge!  But at the same time, I'm annoyed by just *how many* 3rd-party libraries and tools are necessary in order to write a slightly-less-than-trivial JS application that doesn't suck. 

### 1.2 In with the new
I've been wanting to switch my personal website's architecture from being a static frontend-only app to a fully RESTful system for quite some time now. I've also been excitedly watching the development of WebAssembly and Rust's internet capabilities too. I've decided that now is as good as time as ever to actually go ahead and try something new - especially since full REST implementation is really just an ideal that we all must strive for and must continually push ourselves to come ever closer and closer to achieving. I did a bit of experimenting before settling on [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) as a web server and framework, [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for a no-JS frontend solution, and using a handy [rust buildpack](https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust) for deployment on Heroku.

![you build websites with js -> http -> js (es6) -> js (jsx) -> ts (tsx). i build websites with rust -> rust (proc macros) -> http -> rust (trunk) -> wasm-bindgen (idek) -> css. we are not the same](/static/content/blog/new-website/meme.png)

## 2. Writing a multi-page hypertext application like it's 2007 or something
Well, why not? The 2000s are cool again! Also I didn't feel like dealing with WebPack or Node or wrangling multiple processes with Docker, but I also wanted some way of neatly divvying up my frontend into reusable components. That's where HTMX is pretty darn useful - it's a library that gives you the ability to make AJAX requests directly from HTML with attributes. No transpiler, no getting lost in chains upon chains of Promise callbacks, just thinking about things in terms of REST design!

### 2.1 HATEOAS: server-side rendering and HTML templates without turning everything into an unreadable mess
The main thing that has kept me from using HTMX in my personal projects is how easy it is to turn basically every frontend action into an AJAX request. If you're not careful your server will become a giant blob of ad-hoc request handlers returning slightly less giant blobs of ad-hoc HTML fragments. The main thing I really like about React is how straightforward it is to build reusable components and keep the client and server decoupled. It's all very Web 2.0, and it seems to me like the whole Web 2.0 concept has died, been discarded, been reinterpreted, and been revived in the time it took for Web 3.0 to be considered and then abandoned. I.e. over the course of two years, lmao.

It seems to me like HTMX aims to take that same concept, but implement it with a lot less guff. I've been using the library for work for the past two years, and I've seen it go from what I considered an intriguing experiment in minimalism to a pretty cool language-agnostic frontend framework. I think it was their relatively recent additions of client-side templating and query parameters that have really sold me.

## 3. coatesweb: an experiment in web cool.0
One of the things that drew me to Rust is how OP the language is. It's a decently designed compiled language with static types and metaprogramming. Unlike Java or Go, it doesn't have garbage collection and unlike C++, it's designed in such a way to make memory management not a complete nightmare. It works pretty darn well on the web, great in embedded contexts, and has cross-platform support. When you combine that with the proliferation of Platform-as-a-Service companies, recent upgrades in web browser performance, serverless APIs, and emerging AI inference libraries like [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), it seems to me like we're dealing with an ecosystem that's in its early stages of development, but is going to be *very powerful.*

While the cutting-edge deep learning systems are certainly significant, it's not the *only* development in the tech world right now. The mass adoption of models like ChatGPT and LLAMA are really only possible because of how much work has been going into things like container orchestration and load balancing and microservices. I guess my point is, we haven't lost to the machines just yet! There's still more cool stuff to be discovered in the realm of actually sitting down and building websites with code!

That's really the main reason I made the switch to Rust and HTMX - it seems *fresh*. I enjoy the sense of experimentation (while staying safely within my little Heroku setup). I have a bunch of cool projects in mind for this website - who knows, I might actually get around to implementing some of them!

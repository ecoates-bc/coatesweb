I'm a software developer, writer, musician, and content creator (I guess) based in dreary Vancouver, Canada. I wouldn't go as far as calling myself multi-talented - instead I say "I'm turning my ADHD into an entire career."

Here are a few of my interests and/or realms:

## software development!
I'm a senior software developer at the University of British Columbia's department of Mathematics. (I'm also a UBC Alumna!) As an in-house developer I've had the pleasure of playing a role in the development of two open-source pedagogy tools - [Plom](https://plomgrading.org/) and [mbgrader](https://github.com/patrickwalls/mbgrader) - and also helping with Partial Differential Equation solver research! (which mainly involves me trying and failing to understand [Sockeye](https://arc.ubc.ca/sockeye), like I'm a bewildered parent to a moody digital teenager or something.)

## ai research!
Before I was a web developer, I was a research assistant at UBC Linguistics, where I was part of a Natural Language Processing lab for indigenous languages. I've always been fascinated by the intersection of "linguistics," an area that has long been branded a "social science" and its "hard science" neighbors like information theory, artificial intelligence, and computer science. In fact, I published my first solo publication at ACL 2023 and I hope to stay involved with the NLP community as it continues to advance into the Large Language Model era!

## creative writing!
Before *that*, I was part of the 2019 cohort of the UBC Creative Writing BFA program, before dropping out after one term (long story). I'm also a three-time alumna of the [LEAP](https://artsclub.com/education/leap) intensive at the Arts Club theatre here in Vancouver. Playwriting is definitely my area of choice - I've written plays (and been paid for it, too!) for the Cultch, the Frank theatre, and Key City Public Theatre in my hometown of Port Townsend, WA. This year I'm part of the Arts Club's [Emerging Playwrights Unit](https://artsclub.com/artistic-programs/emerging-playwrights-unit)!

## music!
i play jazz (wrong notes)

## other stuff!
I genuinely enjoy moving from topic to topic and synthesizing what I've learned into new things. Some might call that "unfocused" but I'll counter by calling it "creative." I have some big plans that involve web development, open source software, and novel ways of being creative online! (I'm loath to say "emerging media" because of the connotations, but I digress.)
